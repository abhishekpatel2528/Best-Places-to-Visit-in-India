      <h2>The Taj Mahal</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the
        world's most famous testimony to the power of love. Named after Mumtaz
        Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of
        mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen
        until 1648 to complete. <br />
        Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches,
        minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy inlaid around the
        entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble. Adding
        to its splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and
        semi-precious stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of
        pearl. <br />
        The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the atmosphere is
        brilliantly altered by the change in lighting. If possible, try to catch
        a view of the Taj Mahal's reflection from the far bank of the Yamuna
        River-it makes for a memorable (and safe) selfie.

      <h2>HAWA MAHAL, JAIPUR</h2>
      <p>
        The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red
        and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and
        extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. <br />

        The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh,
        grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jaipur,
        India.He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he
        built this grand and historical palace. <br />It was designed by Lal
        Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953
        small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.The
        original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to
        observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below
        without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air
        from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more
        pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.Many people see the Hawa
        Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but
        it is the back

        Ladakh, the capital of Leh, is in the eastern parts of Jammu and
        Kashmir. Ladakh is known for its pristine lakes, freezing winds,
        glaciers and sand dunes. It has kept its distance from the modern world
        – and thank heavens for that. The most famous tourist attractions here
        are Pangong Lake, Tso Moriri lake and Leh Palace. There’s also many
        adventures to be found here, from white water rafting to mountaineering
        and trekking.

      <h2>INDIA GATE, DELHI</h2>
      <p>
        The India Gate (formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war
        memorial located near the Kartavya path on the eastern edge of the
        "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called duty path. It stands as
        a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died
        between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
        Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near
        and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's
        names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are
        inscribed on the gate.Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the
        architectural style of the memorial arch such as the Arch of
        Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in
        Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

      <h2>THE BEACHES, GOA</h2>
      <p>
        Long known within India as the "go-to" destination for those seeking a
        great beach holiday, Goa's beautiful western coastline, overlooking the
        Arabian Sea, has only recently been discovered by tourists from
        overseas. Goa's more than 60 miles of coastline is home to some of the
        world's loveliest beaches, each with their own particular appeal. <br />

        For those looking for peace and quiet, isolated Agonda Beach is a good
        choice, while Calangute Beach is by far the most commercial and crowded.
        For those in search of posh resorts, yoga getaways, and spa vacations,
        the beaches of Mandrem, Morjim, and Ashwem are fashionable among wealthy
        Indians and Westerners alike. Palolem is another one of Goa's popular
        beaches in a beautiful setting. <br />

        While in Goa, be sure to visit the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary.
        This superb attraction is home to thick forests and plenty of fauna,
        including deer, monkeys, elephants, leopards, tigers, and black
        panthers, as well as India's famous king cobras, and some 200 species of
        birds. <br />

        Also worth a visit is Divar Island, accessed by ferry from Old Goa.
        Highlights include Piedade, a typical Goan village and home to the
        Church of Our Lady of Compassion with its interesting stucco work,
        Baroque plaster decorations, and altars, as well as stunning views of
        the surrounding countryside.

    <section class="section3">
      <h2>DUDHASAGAR WATERFALL</h2>
      <p>
        Dudhsagar Falls ('Sea of Milk') is a four-tiered waterfall located on
        the Mandovi River in the Indian state of Goa. It is 60 km from Panaji by
        road and is located on the Belgavi Vasco Da Gama rail route about 46 km
        east of Madgaon and 80 km south of Belgavi. Dudhsagar Falls is amongst
        India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017 feet) and an
        average width of 30 metres (100 feet). <br />

        The falls are located in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem
        National Park among the Western Ghats. The falls are a punctuation mark
        in the journey of the Mandovi River from the Western Ghats to Panjim
        where it meets the Arabian sea. The area is surrounded by deciduous
        forests with rich biodiversity. This waterfall is also known as Tambdi
        Surla to some of the local people. The falls are not particularly
        spectacular during the dry season but during the monsoon season,
        however, the falls are fed by rains and form a huge force of water.

      <h2>SHILLONG, MEGHALAYA</h2>
      <p>
        Shillong is a hill station and the capital of Meghalaya, a state in
        northeastern India, which means "The Abode of Clouds".It is the
        headquarters of the East Khasi Hills district. Shillong is the 330th
        most populous city in India with a population of 143,229 according to
        the 2011 census.It is said that the rolling hills around the town
        reminded the British of Scotland. Hence, they would also refer to it as
        the "Scotland of the East". Shillong has steadily grown in size since it
        was made the civil station of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills in 1864 by the
        British. In 1874, on the formation of Assam as the Chief Commissioner's
        Province, it was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration
        because of its convenient location between the Brahmaputra and Surma
        valleys and more so because the climate of Shillong was much cooler than
        tropical India.Shillong remained the capital of undivided Assam until
        the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, when
        Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya, and Assam moved its capital to
        Dispur in Guwahati.
